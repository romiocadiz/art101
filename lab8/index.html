					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner to figure out anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We believed that we linked out javascript incorrectly but when we looked at the console we realized it was working except we had to take additional steps to show our script in the results. Thanks Wes. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We worked hard on this lab and learned a lot about anonymous functions and callbacks. We put a lot of effort into making our code readable and using the white space in order to have a clean script. We made sure both of us were comfortable with the results and took the time to work on Task X to show our results in our lab. </p>
