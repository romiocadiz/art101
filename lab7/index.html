			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The Challenge was to have a function in our javascript that asked for our name.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Our problem was at first, one line of code was off because one of us did not capitalize a letter however we figured out that thanks to the Javascript console we figured out what went wrong in the code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall this was fun, however we kept overthinking it because we thought we did something wrong when our names came out incorrectly however we realized that was what the function was for.</p>
