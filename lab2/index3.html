    <!-- This is a comment -->
        <p> We are Kamryn and Romi. Kamryn is a cognitive science 4th year while Romi is a film and art 3rd year. We met a few minutes before section because we could not find a way into our classroom due to elevator issues and locked doors. We both took this class because we were interested in learning how to code and wanted hands on practice. We both like:</p>
