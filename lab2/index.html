      <p> We are Kamryn and Romi. Kamryn is a cognitive science 4th year while Romi is a film and art 3rd year. We met a few minutes before section because we could not find a way into our classroom due to elevator issues and locked doors. We both took this class because we were interested in learning how to code and wanted hands on practice.</p>
