			<h1>Lab 10 - Javascript Events and Forms</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, write a html form that uses an event listener in Javascript. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>During this Lab, my partner and I had difficulty finding a good time to work on the lab.
                       We also ran into some issues with the event listener refreshing the page once the button was clicked.
                       We were able to fix this by adding a preventDefault() function to the event listener. We also had trouble
                       with the output not showing up but fixed this by making sure our docucument.getElementById() was correct.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall this assignment was a bit more difficult because we struggled to find a time to meet. We then worked together to create a form with a text input and button. We then created an event listener for the button that would take in the user's name and display it on the page. We also used a function from a previous lab that sorts the name in alphabetical order. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<form>
                       <label for="user-name">Input your name: </label>
                       <input type="text" id="user-name" name="user-name" />
                       <button id="my-button">Click Me!</button>
                   </form>
