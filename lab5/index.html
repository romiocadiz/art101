					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to create a javascript code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not encounter many problems however, we did notice that because we did not add a semi-colon on one of our code lines it added a malfunction. Thankfully we were able to identify it and solve it. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We spent a good amount of time working on the lab and our communication worked well. We did communicate on Discord a lot which was difficult for me to keep track of, however everything worked out well.</p>
