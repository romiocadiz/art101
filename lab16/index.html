					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create a HTML that shows your understanding of JSON and APIs</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I did not understand what was suppose to display on my HTML, even when I looked at Wes's page the instructions confused me more. Then I figured out there was CORs policy that prevented me from having it displayed. I also had an issue with finding a partner because I got extremely busy with my other finals and work. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I tried my best to complete this assignment however I had a lot of issues due to CORS policy and was unable to get it fixed. I will keep experimenting and will try to resubmit if I am able to achieve the result I am looking for.</p>
