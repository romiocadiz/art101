			<h1>Lab 4 - Psceudocode and Javascript</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge was dealing with a new type of file which was Javascript. We also had to learn how to Psceudocode into Javascript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When we put our Psceudocode into our HTML it looked a bit wonky. We figured out that we had to fix it by removing the indentations. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We were very excited to learn about javascript and how to start this new process. We put the same amount of energy and committment to this lab in order to turn it in on time and get the best result we could produce.</p> </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here we put our lists of Tasks 1-4.</p>
					<h4>Psceudocode for a Salsa</h4>
					<p>This is our Pseudocoding for Making Salsa</p>
					<h3>Gather Ingredients</h3>
						<ol>
								<li>Tomatoes</li>
								<li>Jalape単os</li>
								<li>Cilantro</li>
								<li>salt</li>
								<li>pepper</li>
						</ol>
								<h3>Make sure you have cooking supplies</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>Stove</li>
								<li>Cast Iron Skillet</li>
								<li>Blender</li>
								<li>Bowl</li>
								<li>Tongs</li>
							</ol>
									<h3>Make the Salsa</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>Wash and dry hands and then vegetables</li>
									<li>Place cast iron skillet onto stove</li>
									<li>Turn on fire to high</li>
									<li>place tomatoes and jalape単os onto the hot skillet</li>
									<li>Flip occasionally until all ides of the tomatoes and jalape単os are black and blistered</li>
									<li>Turn off stove</li>
									<li>Use tongs to pick up the tomatoes and jalape単os</li>
									<li>Place in the blender and blend until semi-smooth</li>
									<li>Add salt and pepper to taste</li>
									<li>Blend to combine</li>
									<li>Roughly tear up clilantro with hands</li>
									<li>Add to blender</li>
									<li>Blend for a couple seconds</li>
									<li>Pour into bowl</li>
									<li>Enjoy!</li>
								</ol>
