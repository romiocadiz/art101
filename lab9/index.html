			<h1>Lab 9 - Javascript for web</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with a partner to use javascript to create and modify Html elements.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only problems we came across on this lab was trying to find creative fonts and styles to add onto our css that we liked, we struggled to find ones that were available to us but we ended up finding two we liked. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We put a lot of effort into our javascript by adding comments regarding what we were doing and we also experimented with our css in order to get a result that we were happy with. For extra effort we completed Task X to add a little bit of pizzaz. </p>
